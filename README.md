# Hi there, my name is Harry and welcome to my portfolio!

## A bit about me. . . 

Since entering into the field of data analytics I have fallen in love with and curiosity it inspires. What began with the University of Newcastle (UON), followed by the University of New England (UNE) and most recently RMIT online, has grown into a passion for leveraging information to deliver excellent outcomes.

At the University of Newcastle, I studied the intricacies of human behaviour and cultural diversity across time, cultivating practical research skills including but not limited to quantitative & qualitative analysis, survey design, face-to-face interviews and the critical review of academic work.

My Masters in Urban and Regional Planning focused on specialised knowledge grounded in geography, sociology, law, public policy, and economics, and culminated in writing a dissertation on "Do-It-Yourself" Urbanism. This self directed research exposed me to the influence that communities have to shape their environment through informal and collaborative action. Importantly, it showed taught me the value of curiosity and iteration of design, a sentiment that continues to influence my work.

Finally, I acquired a Graduate Certificate in Data Science from RMIT Online equipping me with the tools required to answer complex questions through statistical logic and contemporary data analysis. It allowed me to cultivated practical expertise in statistical investigation, impactful data visualisations and communication, and harnessing tools like R, Python and Power BI. This course sharpened my ability to translate complex raw data into compelling stories, enhance clarity, and provide insights to bolster decision-making effectiveness.

With all of these skills I am committed to furthering my career as a data analyst, leveraging the knowledge and skills I've gained thus far to make a meaningful impact. Whether in environmental management or intelligent urban design, data analysis serves as a catalyst to proactive and intelligent decision making, and armed with a proficiency in statistical analysis and information communication, I am excited to steer decision-making, foster sustainable practices, and contribute to the creation of a resilient global community.
